## Instructions

<details><summary>Local Installation (click to expand)</summary>

### Requirements

- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)
- **GPU:** CUDA is required to process octree observations on GPU. Everything else should function normally on CPU.

### Dependencies

These are the dependencies required to use the entirety of this project. If no "(tested with `version`)" is specified, the latest release from a relevant distribution is expected to function properly.

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads) (tested with `3.8`)
- [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#installation) (tested with `1.7`)
- [ROS 2 Foxy](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Foxy)
- [Ignition Dome](https://ignitionrobotics.org/docs/dome/install)
- [gym-ignition](https://github.com/robotology/gym-ignition)
  - [AndrejOrsula/gym-ignition](https://github.com/AndrejOrsula/gym-ignition) fork is currently required
- [MoveIt 2](https://moveit.ros.org/install-moveit2/source)
- [O-CNN](https://github.com/microsoft/O-CNN)
  - [AndrejOrsula/O-CNN](https://github.com/AndrejOrsula/O-CNN) fork is currently required

Several other dependencies can be installed via `pip` with this one-liner.

```bash
pip3 install numpy scipy optuna seaborn stable-baselines3[extra] sb3-contrib open3d trimesh pcg-gazebo
```

All other dependencies are pulled from git and built together with this repository, see [drl_grasping.repos](drl_grasping.repos) for more details.

> In case you run into any problems along the way, check [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile) that includes the full instructions.

### Building

Clone this repository and import VCS dependencies. Then build with [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io).

```bash
# Create workspace for the project
mkdir -p drl_grasping/src && cd drl_grasping/src
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/AndrejOrsula/drl_grasping.git
# Import and install dependencies
vcs import < drl_grasping/drl_grasping.repos && cd ..
rosdep install -r --from-paths src -i -y --rosdistro ${ROS_DISTRO}
# Build with colcon
colcon build --merge-install --symlink-install --cmake-args "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release"
```

### Sourcing of the Workspace Overlay

Before using, remember to source the ROS 2 workspace overlay.

```bash
source <drl_grasping dir>/install/local_setup.bash
```

This enables:
- Use of `drl_grasping` Python module
- Execution of scripts and examples via `ros2 run drl_grasping <executable>`
- Launching of setup scripts via `ros2 launch drl_grasping <launch_script>`

<details><summary>Docker (click to expand)</summary>

### Requirements

- **OS:** Any system that supports [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) should work (Linux, Windows, macOS). However, only Linux was properly tested.
- **GPU:** CUDA is required to process octree observations on GPU. Therefore, only Docker images with CUDA support are currently available.

### Dependencies

Before starting, make sure your system has a setup for using [Nvidia Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker), e.g.:

```bash
# Docker
curl https://get.docker.com | sh \
  && sudo systemctl --now enable docker
# Nvidia Docker
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release; echo $ID$VERSION_ID) \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add - \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Docker

The easiest way to try out this project is by using the included [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile).

Instead of building it locally, you can pull a pre-built Docker image directly from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/andrejorsula/drl_grasping). Currently, there is only a development image available.

```bash
docker pull andrejorsula/drl_grasping:latest
```

To run the docker, please use the included [docker run](docker/run.bash) script as it significantly simplifies the setup.

```bash
run.bash andrejorsula/drl_grasping:latest /bin/bash
```

> If you are struggling to get CUDA working on your system with Nvidia GPU (no `nvidia-smi` output), you might need to use a different version of CUDA base image that supports the version of your driver.

## Environments

This repository contains environments for robotic manipulation that are compatible with [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym). All of these make use of [Ignition Gazebo](https://ignitionrobotics.org) robotic simulator, which is interfaced via [gym-ignition](https://github.com/robotology/gym-ignition).

Currently, the following environments are included inside this repository. Take a look at their [gym environment registration](drl_grasping/envs/tasks/__init__.py) and source code if you are interested in configuring them.

- [Reach](drl_grasping/envs/tasks/reach) task
  - Observation variants
    - [Reach](drl_grasping/envs/tasks/reach/reach.py) - simulation states
    - [ReachColorImage](drl_grasping/envs/tasks/reach/reach_color_image.py)
    - [ReachDepthImage](drl_grasping/envs/tasks/reach/reach_depth_image.py)
    - [ReachOctree](drl_grasping/envs/tasks/reach/reach_octree.py) (with and without color features)
- [Grasp](drl_grasping/envs/tasks/grasp) task
  - Observation variants
    - [GraspOctree](drl_grasping/envs/tasks/grasp/grasp_octree.py) (with and without color features)
  - Includes [GraspCurriculum](drl_grasping/envs/tasks/grasp/curriculum.py)
    - This curriculum can be used to progressively increase difficulty of the task by automatically adjusting behaviour based on current success rate. It affects the following:
      - Workspace size
      - Number of objects
      - Termination state (task is divided into hierarchical sub-tasks, further guiding the agent)

### Domain Randomization

These environments can be wrapped by a randomizer in order to introduce domain randomization and improve generalization of the trained policies, which is especially beneficial for Sim2Real transfer.

</p>
TODO: Update animation

The included [ManipulationGazeboEnvRandomizer](drl_grasping/envs/randomizers/manipulation.py) allows randomization of the following properties at each reset of the environment.

- Object model - primitive geometry
  - Random type (box, sphere and cylinder are currently supported)
  - Random color, scale, mass, friction
- Object model - mesh geometry
  - Random type (see [Object Model Database](#object-model-database)) 
  - Random scale, mass, friction
- Object pose
- Ground plane texture
- Initial robot configuration
- Camera pose

#### Object Model Database

For database of objects with mesh geometry, this project currently utilises [Google Scanned Objects collection](https://app.ignitionrobotics.org/GoogleResearch/fuel/collections/Google%20Scanned%20Objects) from [Ignition Fuel](https://app.ignitionrobotics.org). You can also try to use a different Fuel collection or just a couple of models stored locally (some tweaks might be required to support certain models).

All models are automatically configured in several ways before their insertion into the world:

- Inertial properties are automatically estimated (uniform density is assumed)
- Collision geometry is decimated in order to improve performance
- Models can be filtered and automatically blacklisted based on several aspects, e.g too much geometry or disconnected components

This repository includes few scripts that can be used to simplify interaction with the dataset and splitting into training/testing subsets. By default they include 80 training and 20 testing models.
- [`dataset_download_train`](scripts/utils/dataset/dataset_download_train.bash) / [`dataset_download_test`](scripts/utils/dataset/dataset_download_test.bash) - Download models from Fuel
- [`dataset_unset_train`](scripts/utils/dataset/dataset_unset_train.bash) / [`dataset_unset_test`](scripts/utils/dataset/dataset_unset_test.bash) - Unset current train/test dataset
- [`dataset_set_train`](scripts/utils/dataset/dataset_set_train.bash) / [`dataset_set_test`](scripts/utils/dataset/dataset_set_test.bash) - Set dataset to use train/test subset
- [`process_collection`](scripts/utils/process_collection.py) - Process the collection with the steps mentioned above

#### Texture Database

`DRL_GRASPING_PBR_TEXTURES_DIR` environment variable can be exported if ground plane texture should be randomized. It should lead to a directory with the following structure.

```bash
├── ./ # Directory pointed to by `DRL_GRASPING_PBR_TEXTURES_DIR`
├── texture_0
  ├── *albedo*.png || *basecolor*.png
  ├── *normal*.png
  ├── *roughness*.png
  └── *specular*.png || *metalness*.png
├── ...
└── texture_n
```

There are several databases with free PBR textures that you can use. Alternatively, you can clone [AndrejOrsula/pbr_textures](https://github.com/AndrejOrsula/pbr_textures) with 80 training and 20 testing textures.

### Supported Robots

Only [Franka Emika Panda](https://github.com/AndrejOrsula/panda_ign) is currently supported, as this project lacks a more generic solution that would allow to easily utilise arbitrary models. If you need to use another robot with this source code, a simple switch to another robot model should not be too complicated, albeit time-consuming.


## Reinforcement Learning

This project makes direct use of [stable-baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) as well as [sb3_contrib](https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines3-contrib). Furthermore, scripts for training and evaluation were largely inspired by [rl-baselines3-zoo](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo).

To train an agent, please take a look at [`ex_train`](examples/ex_train.bash) example. Similarly, [`ex_enjoy`](examples/ex_enjoy.bash) example demonstrates a way to evaluate a trained agent.

TODO: Add graphics for learning curve (TD3 vs SAC cs TQC)

### Octree CNN Features Extractor

The [OctreeCnnFeaturesExtractor](drl_grasping/algorithms/common/features_extractor/octree_cnn.py) makes use of [O-CNN](https://github.com/microsoft/O-CNN) implementation to enable training on GPU. This features extractor is part of `OctreeCnnPolicy` policy that is currently implemented for TD3, SAC and TQC algorithms.

TODO: Add graphics for network architecture

### Hyperparameters

Hyperparameters for training of RL agents can be found in [hyperparameters](hyperparams) directory. [Optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna) was used to autotune some of them, but certain algorithm/environment combinations require far more tuning. If needed, you can try running Optuna yourself, see [`ex_optimize`](examples/ex_optimize.bash) example.
